# High-Performance Computing in Bioinformatics

This is the repository for the INF5380 / INF9380 / NORBIS course on High-Performance Computing in Bioinformatics.

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/torognes/inf9380/wiki) for details about the course.

The Wiki has been updated with the preliminary schedule for spring 2020.


## IMPORTANT NEWS - TEACHING ON CAMPUS CANCELLED

This course cannot be carried out as planned.

UiO is [closing all teaching](https://www.uio.no/english/about/hse/coronavirus/news/from-tomorrow-uio-will-hold-courses-digitally.html) on campus from Friday 13 March 2020 and onwards to reduce the spread of the Corona virus.

There will therefore be no teaching in this course on campus in Oslo in the planned period (23 March to 3 April).

We are currently considering if we can provide this course in an online / digital form or if it needs to be postponed.

Do not hesitate to contact [Torbj√∏rn Rognes](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/people/aca/torognes/) if you have any questions about the course.
